# 01-HW-Code-Refactor

This homework assignment was meant to better understand semantic elements and how much more accessible they are. I replaced the '<div>' elements with their respected counterparts such as 'article' and 'section'. It also helped reinforce the difference between class and id and how they go hand in hand with on site links.
